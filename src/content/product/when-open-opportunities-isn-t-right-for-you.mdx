[ [ Login ] [ Try for free ] Making sure you buy the right product 
## Why you shouldn't use Open Opportunities. 

 Open Opportunities isn't right for everyone, this is when and what you can do instead. How to tell 
## When the fit isn't right. 
# You're not into government 

 If you don’t want to sell to the $13tn public sector market, you might not get what you need. We do have some private sector data but the vast majority of our data is for government contracting opportunities. 
# You sell to a small market 

 If you only sell into a really small, specific market then you can monitor a small number of contract opportunities sources on a regular basis without needing to buy a service like Open Opportunities. 
# Missing opportunities is ok 

 If you only sell when if you’re invited to bid in, or you’re entirely opportunistic about selling to government, then missing opportunities is ok. In that case you just don’t need a comprehensive alert service. If you're ok missing opportunities 
## How to do it yourself 

 There are some free alternatives that can be used instead of a comprehensive service. 
# Government sites 

 Sign up to a handful of different sites that publish opportunities. In the UK it’s Find A Tender, in Europe it’s TED and in the USA it’s SAM. That will get you some opportunities and will get you started but you’re going to miss hundreds of opportunities and the more you need and the searches are inconsistent. 
# DIY market research 

 Use AI tools like Perplexity to do some market research. It won’t be able to tell you things like “how many tenders were there for CRMs in market X last year” but it will be able to spot recent tenders for different services and tell you who is buying different things from the market. 
# Google searches 

 Do daily advanced searches on google for your products and your rivals. Eg. Searching on google using “site:gov.uk” or “site:www.coventry.gov.uk” will give you results for a specific site. So you can use google to see if any news is posted that could be relevant to you. Find and win new business
