# When Open Opportunities isn't right

Open Opportunities isn't right for everyone. This page explains when the fit isn't right and what you can do instead.

<FeatureGrid
heading="When the fit isn't right"
items={[
{
title: "You're not into government",
content: "If you don't want to sell to the $13tn public sector market, you might not get what you need. We do have some private sector data but the vast majority of our data is for government contracting opportunities."
},
{
title: "You sell to a small market",
content: "If you only sell into a really small, specific market then you can monitor a small number of contract opportunities sources on a regular basis without needing to buy a service like Open Opportunities."
},
{
title: "Missing opportunities is ok",
content: "If you only sell when you're invited to bid in, or you're entirely opportunistic about selling to government, then missing opportunities is ok. In that case you just don't need a comprehensive alert service."

## How to do it yourself

There are some free alternatives that can be used instead of a comprehensive service.

<FeatureGrid
items={[
{
title: "Government sites",
content: "Sign up to a handful of different sites that publish opportunities. In the UK it's Find A Tender, in Europe it's TED and in the USA it's SAM. That will get you some opportunities and will get you started but you're going to miss hundreds of opportunities."
},
{
title: "DIY market research",
content: "Use AI tools like Perplexity to do some market research. It won't be able to tell you things like 'how many tenders were there for CRMs in market X last year' but it will spot recent tenders for different services."
},
{
title: "Google searches",
content: "Do daily advanced searches on google for your products and your rivals. Eg. Searching on google using 'site:gov.uk' or 'site:www.coventry.gov.uk' will give you results for a specific site."
