## The methodology

Everything you need to find the right tender opportunities.

The research was conducted during September 2025. Each product was researched by a skilled, independent business analyst. They assessed each product on the basis of seven different factors. The analyst relied on the data published on the individual websites and each product's response to support queries.

### Coverage

The analyst relied on suppliers' own claims and the results of search queries on their sites. Coverage for higher value sources is weighted more highly than low value sources. Some providers claim to have data for more than the total number of countries (195).

### Search

Each search engine was evaluated for the accuracy of 6 different keyword searches, combined with the ability to sort and filter the responses. Products with limited filters, poor usability or inconsistent results were marked down.

### Pricing

Each product was assessed on the total price of using the average per user cost on the median paid tier available to customers. Where pricing was not published we awarded a score of 0 due to lack of transparency.

### Enrichment

Where data has been enriched with useful and consistent data to enable high quality filtering of the data. Each product was evaluated on the quality of the enrichment and the pervasiveness of the enrichment.

### Alerts

Alerts were assessed on the number of alerts provided to each user on the median paid tier available to customers. The number of alert profiles was the sole consideration.

### Support

Multiple contacts with the support services of each product were made. Responses were considered on the basis of timeliness and usefulness of the response.

### Guarantee

The availability of a money back guarantee was the sole criteria. Where none was mentioned on the product site, a zero score was awarded.

### Weightings

We weighted each factor as follows:
- **Coverage: 25 points** - The most important factor
- **Search: 20 points** - Critical for finding opportunities
- **Pricing: 20 points** - Value and transparency matter
- **Enrichment: 15 points** - Enhanced data quality
- **Support: 10 points** - Customer service excellence
- **Alerts: 5 points** - Notification capabilities
- **Guarantee: 5 points** - Risk mitigation
