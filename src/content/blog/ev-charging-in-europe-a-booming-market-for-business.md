According to a recent report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, ["Charging ahead: accelerating the roll-out of EU electric vehicle charging infrastructure"](https://www.acea.auto/publication/automotive-insights-charging-ahead-accelerating-the-rollout-of-eu-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/#:~:text=There%20were%20632%2C423%20public%20charging,public%20charging%20points%20were%20installed.\)) (April 2024), the European electric vehicle (EV) charging market is experiencing rapid expansion and presents significant opportunities for businesses worldwide.

The EU's public charging network comprised 632,423 charging points at the end of 2023, with projections suggesting a need for up to 8.8 million points by 2030. This staggering growth potential underscores why companies should focus on this burgeoning industry in the region.

For businesses, the European EV charging sector offers a wealth of prospects. Our [Open Opportunities platform](https://www.openopps.com/) allows you to delve deep into all government opportunities for EV charging across the EU with just a free trial sign-up.

**Takeaways from the report:**

1. The Netherlands, France, and Germany account for 61% of all EU charging points, highlighting the need for infrastructure development in other member states.

3. The European Commission is calling for 3.5 million charging points by 2030 to support the level of vehicle electrification necessary to reach the proposed 55% CO2 reduction for cars. Reaching this target would require the installation of nearly 2.9 million public charging points in the next seven years. That's almost 410,000 per year or 7,900 per week.

5. There is a strong correlation between public charging point availability and Battery Electric Vehicle sales, suggesting that infrastructure development can drive EV adoption. Between 2017 and 2023, electric car sales increased over 18 times, while the number of public chargers in the EU grew merely sixfold during the same period.
