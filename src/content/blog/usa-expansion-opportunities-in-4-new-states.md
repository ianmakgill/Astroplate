We've just added four new states to our USA opportunity data. Welcome to the Open Opportunities family Montana, New Mexico, Iowa and Delaware. Users can now search for contract and tender opportunities across all of these states with more data on the way.

We're expanding our sources in other countries too, with new data coming through from Australia, Germany and Sweden. Whilst our ultimate goal is to gather every public tender in the world, our focus is getting our users the correct data, the data with the most apparent value.

As well as gathering all the data we can we're also committed to making sure that you can find the opportunities in our database, which is why we're laser focussed on creating the best tender alert service in the world. You can see more information about the improvements we're making to Open Opportunities [here](https://openopps.com/release-notes/ "here").
