Graph _1: Market by month_

Analysing trends across all categories, we observe three major peaks in tender activity: March-April 2023, June-July 2023, and November-December 2023. These consistent peaks across categories represent the optimal times for suppliers to target their bidding efforts, with both opportunity counts and values showing marked increases during these periods.

_Graph 2: Total value of opportunities_

Looking at the broader trend, while the total market value has remained stable at around £5.5bn between 2022-2024, the timing of spending has become more concentrated. This suggests that understanding when to bid has become as crucial as knowing what to bid for.

**Key Insights for Suppliers:**

- Peak bidding season falls in Q3/Q4.
- Higher tender volumes indicate increased competition during peak months.
- More opportunities during peak periods potentially mean better chances of success.
- Early preparation is crucial to handle the surge in opportunities.

For suppliers looking to capitalise on these patterns, having access to comprehensive, timely tender information is crucial.
