Value-driven marketing focuses on creating meaningful value for customers beyond just selling products. Dr Atul Kumar and his academic team described this approach in their paper ["The impact of value-driven marketing techniques on b2b industry: the importance of value-driven marketing in lead generation and customer acquisition in b2b markets"](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Atul-Kumar-135/publication/362154860_The_impact_of_value-driven_marketing_techniques_on_B2B_industry_The_importance_of_value-driven_marketing_in_lead_generation_and_customer_acquisition_in_B2B_markets/links/62d90f16aa3d1326c0cd2109/The-impact-of-value-driven-marketing-techniques-on-B2B-industry-The-importance-of-value-driven-marketing-in-lead-generation-and-customer-acquisition-in-B2B-markets.pdf#page=14) The paper describes how value-driven marketing is gaining importance in B2B markets where relationships and trust are key. Sales leaders should understand how value-driven techniques can generate leads and boost acquisition.

**What is Value-Driven Marketing?**

Value-driven marketing focuses more on the customer's beliefs and emotions than material things. It builds loyalty through shared values and meeting unfilled needs. Companies showcase how their offerings improve customers' business and lives. Pricing is based on the target market's perceived value.

**How Can Value-Driven Marketing Impact Sales?**

- **Lead generation**: Content highlights shared values and solve pain points while reflecting company vision. This resonates more than pushing products.

- **Customer acquisition**: Customers look beyond price to the best value proposition and sustainability. Values-based marketing builds relationships beyond transactions.

- **Pricing strategy**: Price is tied to the value customers see in improving their business, not just material costs. However, this requires extensive market research.

- **Sales conversations**: Discuss how offerings align with customer values to create measurable impact. Emphasise shared commitments.

**Why Does it Matter in B2B?**

Studies show B2B buyers want innovation and partnerships with integrity from suppliers. Value-driven marketing does this by quantifying how offerings increase revenue or reduce costs. It develops trust and meets complex needs by collaborating across the organisation and ecosystem.

**What Are the Limitations?**

- It is hard to justify commodities that lack differentiation.

- Perceived value fluctuates with markets and competition.

- Significant investment is needed in research and production.

- Doesn't work for all consumer segments.

Value-driven marketing takes effort but pays off in stronger relationships, loyalty, and margins. It allows sales leaders to drive impact through shared values rather than competing on price. Strategies should be kept targeted as perceived value changes. With careful execution, it's a critical competitive edge.
