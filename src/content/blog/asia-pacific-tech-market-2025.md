The APAC tech market is where the money's flowing in 2025. The region will drive more than half of a 1.7ppt nominal growth acceleration in global US$-measured tech spending in 2025 based on [research by](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/asia-pacific-region-enterprise-tech-spending-led-by-semiconductor-players/) [Oxford Economics](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/asia-pacific-region-enterprise-tech-spending-led-by-semiconductor-players/). Yes, growth is cooling to 7.6% (down from 10.2% in 2024), but that's still miles ahead of Europe's sluggish 4.3% and the Americas' modest 5.1%. For tech sellers, this is where you want to be focusing your sales efforts.

If you want more data insights into different regions, check our [Digital Tech Procurement Trends: Global Analysis 2025](https://www.openopps.com/global-digital-tech-procurement-trends-2025/). For example, one of our insights shows that European buyers invest heavily in server infrastructure and information systems, with contracts averaging $410 million. Meanwhile, North American organisations focus more on operational software, particularly time accounting systems, with contracts averaging $367 million.

### The APAC Split: Chip Makers vs. Tech Consumers

The Oxford Economics research shows we're looking at two very different beasts:

**1.The Semiconductor Trio: Taiwan, South Korea, and China:**

a) They're buying tech to make tech. Electronic manufacturers are the biggest spenders here.

b) When global demand sneezes, these markets catch a cold - they're highly cyclical.

c) Most spending isn't for their domestic consumption - it's feeding the global supply chain.

**2\. The Consumer Markets: Australia, Japan, and India:**

a) Australia and Japan are all about services, such as communications, IT support, and cloud computing.

b) India's going full-throttle on its digital transformation, pumping serious money into telecommunications.

c) Look at India's spending patterns, and you'll spot something interesting - they're building for the future, with capital expenditure suggesting they're laying digital foundations for years to come

### What This Means for Your Sales Strategy

1.Play to the Right Audience.

Selling to Taiwan, Korea or China? Talk about production efficiency, yield improvement and supply chain resilience. Targeting Australia, Japan or India? Focus on digital transformation, customer experience and business efficiency gains.

2\. Watch the Storm Clouds.

The AI reality check: If AI adoption slows down (and the hype is cooling), semiconductor demand could take a hit.

If you're not tailoring your APAC strategy to these realities, you're leaving money on the table. To access opportunities from APAC and worldwide, [book a demo call](https://www.openopps.com/book-a-call-for-the-best-chance-to-win-bids/) with our team.
