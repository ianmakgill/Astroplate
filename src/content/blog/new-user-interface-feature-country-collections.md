Users can now create their own groups of countries in Open Opportunities.  
  
If you're responsible for selling into a specific market, whether that's EMEA or DACH or the Nordics it can be bothersome to have to enter all of those countries multiple times. Now users can save any list of countries into a 'collection' for reuse later.

Just select the countries you need, as normal and then hit the 'collections' button. Users can save the collection for instant reuse in the future.

At Open Opportunities we want to help users find exactly what they're looking for every time they search. For search that really works, with flexible monthly deals start a free trial: [https://openopps.com](https://openopps.com "Open Opportunities Homepage")
