By analysing historical data on public sector spending and contracts awarded, tech companies can identify specific technology categories receiving investment. Tracking spending fluctuations over time reveals changing priorities and emerging demands of buyers.

Companies can align product roadmaps and R&D pipelines accordingly.

**Assessing Partnership and Competitor Landscapes**

Procurement data contains detailed provider performance metrics, spend allocation and contract details. Tech companies can evaluate potential partnerships with top incumbent vendors or disruption opportunities against lagging competitors. Market share data can also inform go-to-market positioning.

**Applying a Data-Driven Approach**

Integrating procurement data analysis throughout the planning processes enables tech firms to base decisions on government insights, highlighting priorities, pain points, and relationships. Using this data, tech companies can aligned with investment and demand shifts, and tailor their value proposition to public sector clients.

Procurement analytics ultimately provides the intelligence to capture growth opportunities within the sizable and lucrative government technology market. Data can illuminate where resources should be focused and how to craft tender responses.
