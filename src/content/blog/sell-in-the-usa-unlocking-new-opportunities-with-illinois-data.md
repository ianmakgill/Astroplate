Breaking into the American market is a goal for many businesses, and we've got exciting news that could help you achieve just that. We've recently added a new data source from Illinois, opening up more opportunities in the US market.

**Why should you take notice of Illinois data?**

Let's dive into some compelling figures from [the state's recent financial review](https://budget.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/budget/documents/general-funds-operating-quarterly-reports/General-Funds-Quarterly-Report-Q1-FY24.pdf). In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Illinois saw a remarkable surge in base general fund revenues, boasting an increase of $804 million compared to the previous year. This growth was primarily fuelled by robust receipts from sales taxes, investment income, and income taxes.
