The Office of Government Procurement [recently published](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/6ce4e-minister-of-state-smyth-welcomes-sustainable-public-procurement-publication-from-the-ogp/) a comprehensive reference guide on Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) in Ireland. This invaluable resource provides critical information for businesses bidding on public contracts in Ireland.

**Aligning with National and EU Sustainability Policies**

The guide outlines the national, EU, and international policy context behind Ireland's drive for more sustainable procurement. Key policies include the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), [the European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en), and [Ireland's Climate Action Plan.](https://www.notion.so/Navigating-Sustainable-Public-Procurement-in-Ireland-78c3552ed2814f32a0c999bbc3f7377f?pvs=21) Businesses should ensure their operations and supply chains align with relevant sustainability policies.

**Utilising Green and Socially Responsible Criteria**

As well as combining green and socially responsible procurement criteria, guidance, and tools, the document points to extensive resources such as Ireland's Green Public Procurement criteria across ten sectors. The guide also covers accessibility, human rights, and social enterprise considerations.

**Incorporating Sustainability Throughout the Process**

The guide also provides practical guidance on integrating sustainability throughout procurement planning, tender processes, and contract management. This includes market engagement, needs assessment, specifications, award criteria, life cycle costing, and verification. Monitoring and reporting advice is also provided.

This new SPP reference is an indispensable guide for businesses bidding on public contracts in Ireland. It provides extensive resources to build sustainability into procurement processes and align with Ireland's sustainability ambitions. Businesses should familiarise themselves with this guide when participating in public tenders.
