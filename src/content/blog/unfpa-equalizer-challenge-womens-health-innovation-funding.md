The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has launched [**The Equalizer Challenge: Scaling Womenâ€™s Health Innovations**](https://www.unfpa.org/equalizer-challenge-scaling-womens-health-innovations), providing catalytic funding alongside a six-month development programme specifically for women-led healthcare enterprises.

This initiative creates potential opportunities for healthcare suppliers looking to engage with emerging innovations that could shape future procurement trends.

UNFPA's Equalizer Challenge targets women-led enterprises ready to scale beyond pilot stages, focusing on healthcare innovations that reach underserved communities. According to [the press release](https://www.unfpa.org/press/unfpa-launches-equalizer-challenge-scale-women%E2%80%99s-health-innovations), only 1% of global healthcare research and innovation funding addresses female-specific conditions beyond oncology, and just 0.2% of R&D funding focuses on sexual and reproductive health in developing countries. The programme features biweekly coaching, expert mentorship, and direct connections to global health and investment networks to help these enterprises achieve meaningful, scalable impact.

**Healthcare Procurement Trends Create Opportunities for Women-Led Startups**

Our [Global Medical & Healthcare Supply Chain Analysis](https://www.openopps.com/global-healthcare-analysis-2025/) reveals significant insights relevant to healthcare startups. Recording and monitoring systems show a consistent trend toward shorter contract durations, declining from 24.8 months in 2022 to 16.1 months in 2024, suggesting a more dynamic procurement environment for healthcare technology solutions.
