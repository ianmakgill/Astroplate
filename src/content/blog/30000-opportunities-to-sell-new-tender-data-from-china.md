In a groundbreaking development for international business, we are thrilled to announce the addition of a vast array of new tenders from China to our **[Open Opportunities platform](https://www.openopps.com/).** This influx of data presents an unprecedented chance for bid managers, sales executives, and business development professionals to tap into one of the world's most dynamic and rapidly expanding markets.

**Global Expansion: Over 100 Fresh Opportunities Every Day**

The sheer volume of new business prospects is staggering. In the past week alone, we've incorporated an additional 30,000 opportunities from China into our database.

What sets these tenders apart is their accessibility. All listings are available in English, eliminating language barriers and allowing international businesses to compete on a level playing field. This move by Chinese organisations to publish tenders in English demonstrates a clear intent to attract global sellers and foster international trade relationships.

This translates to over 100 new potential deals emerging daily, spanning various industries and sectors, and there are 662 open today, with the breadth of these opportunities being truly remarkable:

- Medical equipment with purchases for chemicals X-rays, MRIs, and Ultrasound

- A helicopter procurement in Shanghai.

- Laboratory reagents and chemicals.

- Everything from high technology to climate change monitoring.

- Software purchases from sensors to modelling and more.
