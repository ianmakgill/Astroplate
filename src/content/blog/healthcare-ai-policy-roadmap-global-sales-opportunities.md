[AdvaMed has released](https://repertoiremag.com/advamed-releases-ai-policy-roadmap-to-guide-congress-and-federal-agencies.html) its "AI Policy Roadmap" to guide US lawmakers on regulating AI-enabled medical technologies. This development signals substantial commercial opportunities for global healthcare technology sales teams, as regulatory clarity in the US market typically catalyses adoption patterns worldwide.

[\*The Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed)](https://www.advamed.org/), is an American medical device trade association, based in Washington, D.C. It is the largest medical device association in the world with U.S. and international members who are medical technology companies (medical devices, diagnostic products, and health information systems) that collectively represents 80% of U.S. medical technology firms in the United States, that produce close to 90% of annual health care technology purchases in the United States and more than 40% globally.\*

**How Regulatory Shifts Drive AI MedTech Procurement**

The roadmap addresses three critical areas that have hindered healthcare AI commercialisation: patient privacy frameworks, regulatory approval pathways, and reimbursement mechanisms for AI-enabled medical devices.

With over 1,000 AI-enabled medical devices receiving FDA authorisation in the past 25 years—ranging from prostate cancer detection software to cardiac monitoring algorithms—the guidelines establish precedents that international regulators often follow. AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker's characterisation of the AI landscape as "vast and bright" but "mostly to be determined" highlights the first-mover advantage for sales organisations ready to navigate this evolving landscape.

**Medical Device Market Growth: Regional Spending Patterns 2023-2025**

Our [Global Healthcare Analysis](https://www.openopps.com/global-healthcare-analysis-2025/) reveals compelling international market intelligence for sales leaders. Contract duration trends show medical device procurement contracts are lengthening globally (from 23.3 months in 2023 to 31.9 months in 2024), with European contracts averaging 3.8 years versus 2.1 years in Asian markets.

Value distribution varies dramatically by region - European dental and medical device opportunities average £4.2 million per contract. The spending pattern graph reveals European buyers prefer framework agreements (72% of procurement value) while Asian buyers show strong preference for just-in-time purchasing (28% framework usage), indicating the need for tailored sales approaches by region.
