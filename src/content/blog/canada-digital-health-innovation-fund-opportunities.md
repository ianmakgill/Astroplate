## How to Access Canadian Healthcare Funds

The Terry Fox Research Institute [launched](https://www.dhdp.ca/updates/news-item/terry-fox-research-institute-launches-25-million-digital-health-innovation-fund-to-fuel-private--and-public-sector-approaches-for-ai-machine-learning-and-big-data-initially-focused-on-precision-medicine-for-cancer-and-neuroscience) a $25-million Digital Health Innovation Fund to fuel Canadian private and public sector breakthroughs focused, initially, on precision medicine for cancer and neuroscience, and other diseases through big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches and solutions. The program is being established through the Digital Health and Discovery Platform, led by TFRI, with funding provided by Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada under its Strategic Innovations Fund (SIF), Stream 4.

The Digital Health Innovation Fund operates through Canada's Innovation, Science, Economic Development (SIF, Stream 4) program, supporting projects valued between $1-5 million. To qualify, suppliers must form consortiums that include at least two Canadian SMEs (under 499 employees) and incorporate a data provider willing to share healthcare information through the DHDP platform. The application process begins with an Expression of Interest (due July 15, 2025), followed by Letters of Intent (August 15, 2025), with funding commencing January 2026.
