Germany's coalition government has [announced](https://themunicheye.com/implications-coalition-agreement-digital-policy-17220) plans to establish a Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs, signalling a fundamental restructuring of the country's digital policy framework.

This development creates significant opportunities for technology vendors targeting enterprise software, cybersecurity, and infrastructure modernisation in Europe's largest economy.

**Coalition Agreement Creates New Digital Governance Structure**

On April 9, 2025, the new coalition partners CDU/CSU, and SPD [presented](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-cdu-csu-and-spd-announce-coalition-government-deal/live-72180120) their agreement for the 2025-2029 legislative term, which includes one of the most comprehensive digital reform platforms from a German government to date.

The 126-page agreement proposes a dedicated Digital Ministry tasked with coordinating cross-departmental digital projects across administrative digitalisation, digital identities, data policy, and AI strategy. The government intends to draft a comprehensive data code and establish data trust models to create legally secure intermediaries between data owners, users, and third parties.

**Cybersecurity and Cloud Infrastructure Prioritised**

Notably, the agreement outlines plans for a legal overhaul of cybersecurity, transforming the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) from an advisory body into an authoritative agency with intervention rights over critical infrastructure operators. The government also aims to establish a 'sovereign administrative cloud' with defined national and European security standards, potentially creating opportunities for cloud solution providers.

**European Tech Procurement Trends Support Growth Forecast**

According to our [Digital Tech Procurement Trends report](https://www.openopps.com/global-digital-tech-procurement-trends-2025/), security solutions have shown the strongest growth in the tech sector, increasing by 49.7% from 350 procurement opportunities in 2022 to 524 in 2024. Infrastructure software also showed positive growth of 9.4%.
