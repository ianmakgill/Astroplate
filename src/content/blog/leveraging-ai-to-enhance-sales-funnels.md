Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the business sales process. A recent [study by Paschen, Wilson, and Ferreira (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681320300033) reviewed how sales managers can leverage AI to enhance performance at each sales funnel stage.

Based on their analysis, the key ways AI augments human intelligence across prospecting, presentation, closing, and follow-up are below.

**Automating Lead Generation and Qualification**

Paschen, Wilson, and Ferreira explain that AI excels at analysing structured and unstructured data from various sources to build detailed prospect profiles and uncover potential leads. Machine learning allows AI to continuously improve lead generation and scoring models without reprogramming. Although AI automates finding and evaluating leads, the authors note that sales reps still need to interpret AI results and put them in a business context.

**Enhancing Sales Presentations**

The researchers highlight that AI enables rapid prototyping, so sales reps can deliver tailored solutions faster. It also optimises presentation content and layout for maximum impact. AI can analyse verbal and nonverbal cues from presenters and the audience to provide feedback. The research emphasises that while AI assist the sales process, sales reps are still vital for building rapport, addressing ambiguity, and finalising materials.

**Overcoming Objections and Closing Deals**

The authors describe how AI generates competitive intelligence to counter objections quickly. It also enables dynamic pricing based on lead data. Although AI can answer common questions, Paschen, Wilson, and Ferreira note that sales repsâ€™ interpersonal skills are indispensable for persuasive communication, interpreting emotions, and adjusting approaches.

**Streamlining Follow-Up**

The researchers explain that AI automates order processing, inventory, and supply chain management workflows. It also uses past data to uncover cross-selling opportunities. Chatbots can initiate post-purchase discussions to learn about experiences and future needs. Yet the authors state that sales reps oversee operations and strengthen relationships through personalised, human follow-up.

The authors emphasise that AI should enhance rather than replace the sales process. AI excels at data analysis, while humans excel at relationship building. With the right strategies, sales managers can maximise the value of collaborative human and artificial intelligence.
