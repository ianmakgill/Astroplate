Staying ahead of the curve is paramount for technology companies vying for lucrative government contracts in the European Union's burgeoning digital infrastructure market. In their insightful report ["Unlocking Digital Infrastructure: European Market Drivers and Trends,"](https://www.lw.com/admin/upload/SiteAttachments/Unlocking-Digital-Infrastructure-European-Market-Drivers-and-Trends.pdf) authors Alexander "Stefan" Rieger, Tobias Larisch, and Johannes Groß from Latham & Watkins shed light on key trends and considerations that tech firms must master to secure these coveted opportunities.

**The Digital Infrastructure Goldmine**

The digital infrastructure sector, encompassing fibre optics, data centres, and towers, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in investment across Europe. Deal counts and values have skyrocketed year-over-year, with 2024 poised to set new records for transaction activities. This growth is propelled by the escalating demand for data sovereignty, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, and the underlying infrastructure required to support them.

**Mastering the Data Centre Domain**

Data centres are the heartbeat of the digital economy and are a prime target for government contracts. However, securing these projects requires a deep understanding of the intricate processes involved, from land acquisition to power supply and construction. Moreover, with sustainability and energy efficiency becoming paramount, tech companies must demonstrate their ability to leverage innovative solutions, such as waste heat reuse and proximity to existing communal heating systems.

The report also emphasises the importance of aligning with the preferred operating models, whether edge, co-location, or hyperscale-oriented. Navigating contractual complexities, such as transfer restrictions, change of control clauses, and confidentiality agreements, is crucial for ensuring a seamless entry or exit strategy.

**Capitalising on Fibre and Tower Opportunities**

While mobile phone and broadband subscription rates remain high across Europe, the demand for fibre connectivity and towers continues to soar. Countries like Germany, which lag in fibre network and tower expansion, present lucrative opportunities for tech companies that can effectively address customer activation challenges and secure financing to meet escalating construction costs.

**Overcoming Obstacles and Mitigating Risks**

Despite the promising prospects, tech companies must be prepared to confront potential challenges head-on. These include the risk of network overbuild, supply chain disruptions, sustainability concerns, and the looming threat of technological obsolescence. Agility, adaptability, and a proactive approach to risk mitigation will be essential for securing and maintaining government contracts in this rapidly evolving landscape.

By leveraging the insights in Latham & Watkins' report, technology companies can position themselves as formidable contenders for government contracts in the EU's booming digital infrastructure sector, unlocking opportunities and driving innovation forward.
