We've added new context for customers typing into our search boxes. A long list of search terms can be hard for users to make sense of. We also wanted to add extra search context for our customers. Using lozenges provides that context, as well as making it easier to dismiss a search term. You no longer have to find the text, select it and delete it from the search field, instead you can simply click on the 'x' decal to the right of the lozenge.

We've now automated the use of operators, giving users the ability to see whether they're searching for terms inclusively (**OR**) or exclusively (**AND**).

By clicking the operator button between keywords, you can now instantly toggle how your search terms are combined. This makes it simple to build more complex queries without having to manually type boolean operators. For example, you can easily switch a search from "Artificial Intelligence **and** Machine Learning" to "Artificial Intelligence **or** Machine Learning" to broaden your results.

This small change makes it easier for our customers to understand what is happening in their search. Type a search term and add a comma to instantly create an "or" feature. Improved context and visual features makes our search more transparent and powerful, giving you greater control with just a single click.

We're committed to 'sweating the small stuff' - we want to make our customer's search experience better every day. You can see more information about the improvements we're making to Open Opportunities [here](https://openopps.com/release-notes/ "here").
