## Comprehensive Guide to Securing Government Contracts in Colombia: Trade Frameworks and Regulatory Requirements

Colombia’s public procurement market offers substantial opportunities for both domestic and international businesses, representing approximately **10–13%** of national GDP. However, firms entering this market must navigate carefully the legal frameworks, trade policies, and procedural requirements established by Colombian authorities. This guide compiles essential information from official governmental and intergovernmental sources to assist companies in effectively approaching public procurement opportunities in Colombia.

### Legal Framework Governing Public Procurement

#### Primary Legislation

Colombian public contracting operates principally under the following primary legislation:

- **Law 80 of 1993:** Establishes fundamental principles of transparency, fairness, and equal treatment among bidders irrespective of nationality.
- **Law 1150 of 2007:** Introduces enhanced competitive mechanisms, including reverse auctions and electronic procurement submissions.
- **Decree 1082 of 2015:** Consolidates administrative procurement procedures, standardising practices across all public entities in Colombia.

#### Digital Transformation via SECOP Platforms

The Colombian National Public Contracting Agency (_Colombia Compra Eficiente_) has developed the **SECOP** system, aimed at centralising tender-related information onto a single digital platform:

- Mandatory deployment commenced in December 2025, with full nationwide integration expected by mid-2026.
- Features include secure document uploads, real-time bid tracking, and an integrated application programming interface (API) to streamline procurement operations.

### International Trade Agreements Facilitating Market Access

Although not part of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), Colombia provides preferential market access to foreign suppliers through bilateral and regional trade agreements.

#### United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA)

- Implemented in May 2012, this agreement eliminates tariffs on over USD 19 billion in annual traded goods and ensures non-discriminatory access for U.S. firms to Colombian government tenders above pre-defined thresholds.

#### European Union-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA)

- Effective since August 2013, this agreement ensures reciprocal access to services and infrastructure projects valued above EUR 200,000, subject to compliance with mutual technical, labour, and environmental standards.

### Registration Prerequisites and Documentation Checklist

Foreign entities must complete specific procedural steps to participate in Colombian government tenders:

#### Step 1 – National Suppliers Registry (Registro Único de Proponentes)

Companies must register via the SECOP portal by submitting the following documents:

- A notarised, apostilled, and officially translated certificate of incorporation.
- A Tax Identification Number issued by Colombia’s tax authority, Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN), verifying regulatory compliance and VAT obligations.
- Bank references demonstrating solvency, including a minimum operational history of three years and financial credibility equivalent to approximately COP 500 million (approx. £100,000).

#### Step 2 – Commodity-Specific Registrations

- For contracts involving commodities such as hydrocarbons, minerals, or agricultural products, registering Form No. 2573 with DIAN’s online system is mandatory within one month of contract signing to avoid fines.

#### Step 3 – Validation of Technical Capacity

Depending on the industry, additional certifications may be required, such as environmental management (ISO 14001) or sector-specific operating licences accredited by Colombia's Superintendency of Industry and Commerce (SIC).

### Tendering Procedures and Strategic Considerations

Colombian public procurement processes typically follow structured protocols, including the following competitive bidding types:

#### Open Bidding (Licitación Pública)

- This standard procedure for high-value contracts involves nationwide publication and unrestricted bidder participation.
- A typical procurement timeline averages 90 days from bid publication to award notification, including clarification periods and evaluation assessments.
- Common evaluation criteria comprise price competitiveness (40–60%), technical capability (30–50%), and sustainability commitments (10–20%).

Note: Although domestic preferences are absent in legislation, procurement committees often favour local entities through discretionary scoring of SMEs meeting quality and cost requirements. Establishing local partnerships is beneficial for new foreign entrants.

### Compliance and Risk Mitigation Strategies

Given Colombia’s rigorous anti-corruption measures, foreign participants should implement proactive risk mitigation practices:

- Engaging independent audits to verify the legitimacy and compliance of supply-chain affiliates and subcontractors.
- Leveraging trade assessment tools provided by international entities, such as the EU’s MyTradeAssistant, to comply adequately with bilateral trade commitments concerning taxation and VAT reimbursements post-contract fulfillment.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Successfully securing Colombian government contracts necessitates rigorous preparation to meet legal and procedural requirements. Key recommendations for international businesses include:

- Early engagement with qualified local legal consultants to guide through complex bureaucratic processes and compliance with tax, labour, and subcontracting regulations.
- Continuous monitoring of updates from Colombia's Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism (_MinCIT_) on ongoing reforms affecting procurement, dispute resolution mechanisms, and SME participation, aligned with Colombia's broader economic development goals.
