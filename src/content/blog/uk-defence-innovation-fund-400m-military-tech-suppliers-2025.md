The UK has formally [launched UK Defence Innovation (UKDI)](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-new-body-to-harness-innovative-tech-for-the-uks-armed-forces) with £400 million ringfenced within the Ministry of Defence (MOD) budget, designed to streamline the delivery of innovative technology to Armed Forces personnel.

For defence and security sales managers, this represents a fundamental shift towards "wartime pace" innovation, with the government promising different ways of contracting to enable UK companies of all sizes to scale up innovative prototypes rapidly.

## Breaking Down Procurement Barriers

UKDI will simplify and streamline the innovation system within the MOD, taking a new approach by moving quickly and decisively, using different ways of contracting. The body will focus on dual-use technology - innovations with both civilian and military applications - creating a clear pathway from initial production to manufacturing at scale. This includes establishing a new Rapid Innovation Team (RIT), enabling innovation at 'wartime pace' by utilising commercially available dual-use technology to address the most urgent operational problems.

The announcement comes alongside the renaming of UK Strategic Command to Cyber & Specialist Operations Command, reflecting enhanced focus on cyber capabilities after the MOD had to protect UK military networks against more than 90,000 'sub-threshold' attacks in the last two years. UKDI will be fully operational by July 2026, with Regional Engagement Teams across the UK specifically designed to identify and support dual-use innovation from SMEs and academic spin-outs, delivering targeted outreach and business development support.

## What Our Global Analysis Reveals

Our comprehensive [Defence and Security Procurement Trends: Global Analysis 2025](https://www.openopps.com/defence-procurement-trends-global-analysis-2025/) shows why UKDI's focus on innovation is perfectly timed. The **Command, Control, Communication and Computer Systems** category has seen the most dramatic shift in procurement patterns, with contract durations jumping from 37 months in 2022 to 82 months in 2024—a 123% increase that signals buyers want long-term strategic partnerships rather than short-term component purchases.
