How much do you hate the digital obstacle course that is part of qualifying bids? The real data that bidders need is hidden in the specification docs but these can't be found without visiting multiple sites which you also have to register for. Today we're starting to bring that to an end. Today we've started adding attachments to as many opportunities as we can.

That means that Open Opportunities users don't always have to engage in a 'click safari' to find the documents they need for their work. Instead with a single click they can download all of the attachments that we've been able to gather up.

This represents a huge time saving for our customers, who will be able to find the most relevant opportunities and increasingly make the fastest bid / no bid decisions because they have access to better data than their rivals.

If you want a tender alert service that really delivers on its promise of providing the right data with the best search tools and flexible billing you needn't look any further than Open Opportunities.
