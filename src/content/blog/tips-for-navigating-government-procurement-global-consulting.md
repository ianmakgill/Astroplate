Consultancies can unlock tremendous value by tapping into the wealth of worldwide government procurement data. This article explores key tips for effectively accessing and analysing government procurement data to drive international expansion.

**Defining Your Objectives**

Before diving into procurement data, clearly define your objectives. Do you want to identify new geographical targets? Pinpoint emerging market demand? Assess supplier landscape? Competitor activity? Outline precise goals so you can query data accordingly to extract relevant insights. Well-defined objectives allow focused analysis.

**Securing Reliable Data Sources**

Carefully select reputable data sources like sanctioned government databases for accuracy. Our team maintains procurement data for over 150 countries from 700+ sources. We handle collecting, cleaning, and organising it so you can focus on strategy. If you rely on complete or accurate data, risk recommendations are only on the mark. Prioritise trustworthy sources.

**Understanding Data Classifications**

Get familiar with how procurement data is structured into categories like contract details, supplier information, product descriptors, and contract values. Grasping these classifications helps you navigate datasets to isolate valuable nuggets. Know what insights reside in each data bucket.

**Learning Key Terminology**

Develop fluency with procurement terms like “Request for Proposal”, “Awarded Contract”, “Bid”, and “Contract Value”. These are essential for practical data analysis. Understand terminology specifics to avoid misinterpreting insights.

**Employing Search Filters**

Government procurement data can be vast, so utilise filters to narrow your focus. Refine searches by date ranges, keywords, product categories, geography, or other parameters to extract relevant subsets of data. Search filters are vital for honing in on actionable insights.

**Assessing Suppliers**

Examine supplier performance metrics like contracts won, historical spend share, delivery records, and scores. This reveals reputable partners and underperformers to avoid potentially. Procurement data provides objective supplier intelligence.

**Informing Pricing and Budgets**

Contract values indicate the scale of government budgets by sector and location. Use this intelligence to guide cost baseline suggestions and optimise pricing models to match demonstrated spending power.

**Prioritising Geographies**

Geographic procurement data highlights activity concentrations. Focus business development, marketing, and consulting efforts on data-backed hotspots of present and future opportunities.

**Monitoring Updates**

Procurement data evolves constantly, so stay on top of new releases and consider automating alerts for priority updates.

The bottom line is that procurement data needs to be more valuable for consultancies to overlook. Follow these tips to integrate analytics into your expanding approach. Procurement data insights will become a strategic pillar for scaling your consulting services globally.
