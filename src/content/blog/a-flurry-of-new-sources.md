We're adding new sources at a gallop.

In September we added fourteen new sources, including grants from Australia, data from Bahrain, two new sources in the nordics, a new NATO source and yet another source from Iowa in the USA.

We've also been adding attachments to our sources so now we're gathering new attachments from the United Nations as well as sources in Spain, Germany, USA and Australia.

At Open Opportunities we remain committed to building on our status as the number one ranked global tender alert service in the world. That means going further than everyone else. We gather more data, add more enhancements and build better search terms. That unflinching commitment to high quality means that our customers can rely on Open Opportunities to find the right opportunities for their business every day.
