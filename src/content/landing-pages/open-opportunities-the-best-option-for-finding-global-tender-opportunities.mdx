## The methodology 

 Everything you need to the right tender opportunities. 

 The research was conducted during September 2025. Each product was researched by a skilled, independent business analyst. They assessed each product on the basis of seven different factors. She relied on the data published on the individual websites and each products response to support queries. 
# Coverage 

 The analyst relied on suppliers own claims and the results of search queries on their sites. Coverage for higher value sources is weighted more highly than low value sources. Some providers claim to have data for more than the total number of countries (195). 
# Search 

 Each search engine was evaluated for the accuracy of 6 different keyword searches, combined with the ability to sort and filter the responses. Products with limited filters, poor usability or inconsistent results were marked down. 
# Pricing 

 Each product was assessed on the total price of using the average per user cost on the median paid tier available to customers. Where pricing was not published we awarded a score of 0 due to lack of transparency. 
# Enrichment 

 Where data has been enriched with useful and consistent data to enable high quality filtering of the data. Each product was evaluated on the quality of the enrichment and the pervasiveness of the enrichment. 
# Alerts 

 Alerts were assessed on the number of alerts provided to each user on the median paid tier available to customers. The number of alert profiles was the sole consideration. 
# Support 

 Multiple contacts with the support services of each product were made. Responses were considered on the basis of timeliness and usefulness of the response. 
# Guarantee 

 The availability of a money back guarantee was the sole criteria. Where none was mentioned on the product site, a zero score was awarded. 
# Weightings 

 We weighted each factor as follows: Coverage 25, Search 20, Pricing 20. Enrichment 15, Support 10, Alerts 5. Guarantee 5. Widely used data
