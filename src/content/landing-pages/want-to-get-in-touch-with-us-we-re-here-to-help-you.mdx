This new platform, signifies our commitment to ushering in a new era of transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in the global government procurement market.

We have a relentless focus on building search tools that surface the right data in the right order. As well as giving you the insights and information you need to win bids. 

 03 [

 Join us in reshaping the future of global government procurement. The need for transparency 
## Open data 

 We passionately believe that transparency in procurement is an effective counterweight to corruption and inefficiency. 

 01 [ 
#### Our principles 

 In a rapidly evolving market, it is more important than ever to know who bought what from whom. The changing landscape, heavily impacted by AI demands new levels of accuracy and trustworthiness. 

 That’s why Open Opportunities publishes our data under an open license so that anyone can use it. 

 02 [ 
#### Researchers 

 We publish our data openly so that researchers and analysts can use that data to better understand the buying activities of governments and to drive a better understanding of the global market for procurement data. 

 Researchers can get in touch to access our data. 

 03 [ 
#### Enhanced, open data 

 Because we enhance our data using machine learning and AI, researchers can use our data to create new insights and new analyses of the market. 

 With common, clean country names, categories and mapped currencies it is possible to use our data to compare procurements from around the world. 

 04 [ 
#### Clear provenance 

 Every item in our database is given a clear provenance: we record exactly what we gathered, when we gathered it and where it was gathered. 

 All our augmentations are documented and isolated. So anyone using our data can rely on it's integrity and viability. 

 05 [ 
#### Why Open Data matters 

 The $13tn market for government contracts is the largest single market on earth, but it is also beset with well documented problems, inefficiency, a lack of competition and in some cases corruption. 

 Covid showed that our governments need to be held to account for the purchasing decisions they make. Transparency and open data is the best way to do this. 

 06 [ 
#### Better futures 

 Open data can't solve the problem of corruption in government contracts, but it can make it just that little bit harder to act corruptly. Simply by gathering the available data we make it possible to spot anomalies, find missing records and show deviations. Team Members
