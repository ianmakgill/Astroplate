### Licensing 

 

 
### Legal/Licence info 

 

 

 The goal of the Open Opportunities websites (“Open Opportunities”) is to allow users to analyse government procurement data. We strongly believe in open data, but we are still a business and Open Opportunities is a profit making enterprise. Open Opportunities is published by Ticon UK Ltd, a company limited by shares and registered in England under company number 04962733 (“we”, “us”, “our”). These are the terms on which we make Open Opportunities website available to you: 

 

 

 We offer free and paid for access to our products. If you have agreed to a paid-for use of our services or API, these terms and conditions supplement that contract and, in cases of conflict, the wording of the paid-for contract will take precedence. 

 

 
### Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability 

 

 

 The content available through the Item being technically accessible and publicly available current procurement data for public contract notices, awards and related notice data for the organisations that are bound by the public procurement regulations (“Public Procurement Data”), together with related information, text, images, artwork, features, analytical tools, functionalities or other content as may be available from Ticon UK Ltd and any representation or analysis of such data or other content as well as historical Public Procurement Data held by Ticon UK Limited insofar as it is or may be made available by Ticon UK Limited. In some cases the Public Procurement Data may have errors which we have not yet detected and in other cases the data has been provided in very complex and impenetrable formats, which may have given rise to errors in the way it is presented on Open Opportunities. Therefore we cannot make any promises as to the quality of Public Procurement Data. You use the Public Procurement Data entirely at your own risk. 

 

 

 For this reason, and because Open Opportunities is sometimes made available without charge, we limit our liability as follows: 

 

 

 Open Opportunities is provided “AS IS” and on an “IS AVAILABLE” basis without any representations or any kind of warranty made (whether express or implied by law) to the extent permitted by law, including the implied warranties of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, compatibility, security and accuracy. 

 

 

 Under no circumstances will we be liable for any of the following losses or damage (whether such losses were foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise): (a) loss of data; (b) loss of revenue or anticipated profits; (c) loss of business; (d) loss of opportunity; (e) loss of goodwill or injury to reputation; (f) losses suffered by third parties; or (g) any indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising from the use of Open Opportunities regardless of the form of action. 

 

 

 We do not warrant that functions contained in Open Opportunities content will be uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be corrected, or that Open Opportunities or the servers that make it available are free of viruses or bugs. 
### Paying customers 

 Subject to the following limitations an organisation that pays to access Open Opportunities (“Licensee”) shall have a fully paid-up, royalty-free, revocable, non-exclusive licence to access and use Open Opportunities and any content therein (“the Item”) for named employees of the Licensee (“Users”). 

 The Licensee shall not use the Item and any content therein for the purpose of creating any product or service similar to, either in whole or in part, to any service provided by Ticon UK Limited. This includes but is not limited to: the provision of Public Procurement Data to users external to the Licensee; the use of any of our data in any machine learning models and chatbot tools, save with the written permission from Ticon UK Limited. The Licensee may not cause, through intent or negligence, a user to create a product or service similar to, either in whole or in part, to the Item, whether for use internal to that User’s organisation or any and all external use. 

 Use of the Item is conditional upon payment of all fees due to Ticon UK Limited. If the Licensee fails to pay any fees due Ticon UK Limited, at its sole discretion Ticon UK Limited may suspend the Licensee’s rights to the Item until such time that the fees have been paid. This quotation may be accepted to form a binding contract upon agreement of these terms. 

 

 Your use of Open Opportunities 

 

 

 Our goal is to make purchasing information widely available and available for reuse, and because of that we provide an API to allow easy access to the underlying data. However, we do need to ensure that we can continue to provide the service for the benefit of all, and so need to charge for access to the site. You must not scrape the Open Opportunities website to extract data, and if you wish to make use of purchasing data in bulk, then you should contact us. 

 

 

 For this reason, and others (e.g. abuse, spam, etc), we may have to forbid use of Open Opportunities in some circumstances. You may not use Open Opportunities if we have previously forbidden you to do so, nor may you do so on behalf of someone else we have forbidden from using Open Opportunities. Access to Open Opportunities in these circumstances may constitute a criminal offence under section 1 of the UK Computer Misuse Act 1990. We will consider prosecuting individuals or companies who access our site when forbidden to do so.
