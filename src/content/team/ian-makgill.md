what happens when I type in here:

### Color Palette

* Skin Tones: In B\&W, skin becomes just texture and tone. In color, you’ll want natural but slightly desaturated skin so it feels editorial, not glossy beauty.
* Background: Keep the neutral grey backdrop, but with a cool or slightly desaturated hue (steel grey, muted charcoal). This prevents color clash and keeps focus on the face.
* Wardrobe: Since the shirt is dark, it should remain almost-black but with a subtle tint (navy, deep charcoal, or near-black green).

***

### 3. Contrast & Saturation

* Contrast: Lower it a notch compared to B\&W, so you preserve color detail in shadows and highlights.
* Saturation: Avoid high saturation. Use a muted palette (like fashion/editorial photography). Think subtle, cinematic tones rather than vibrant.

### 4. Lighting Adjustments
