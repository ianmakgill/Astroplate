# Test Research Entry

This is a placeholder entry used to verify that the **Research** collection is properly configured and synced between Astro and Sitepins.

If you can see this file appear in Sitepins (under “Research”) and your Astro dev server rebuilds cleanly, everything is connected and working as expected.
